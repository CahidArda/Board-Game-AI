# Board-Game-AI

In this project; I tried to create a system where any board game is easily implemented and also played by an AI using Minimax tree search.

Implementing games like chess and go are not possible yet, since they both require some intricate conditions like how a pawn moves differently normally and when there is a piece of the opponent nearby. I am still thinking of how this and other conditions can be implemented in a universal board game system.
